##Volley Request Manager

On mine 3 years of developing practice every second project had feature like Http Client or Image Loader and can be easily done with [Volley][1]. Thats why I decided to develop some sort of model that can provide easy and reusable interface for it.

Look on this great and easy to understand article from [Dmytro Danylyk][2] - [Volley Part 2 - Application Model][3]. As he said if you want to control your request and queues from different parts of application, you need to use [Singleton][4].

You can create it like this :

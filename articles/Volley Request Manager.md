##Volley Request Manager

On mine 3 years developing practice every second project had feature that can be done much easier with Volley. Thats why I decided to develop some sort of model that can provide easy and reusable interface for this library.

Look on this grate and easy to understand article from [Dmytro Danylyk][1] - [Volley Part 2 - Application Model][2]. As he mentored if you want to control your request and queues from different parts of application, you need to use [Singleton][3].

You can create it like this :
